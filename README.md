# cryptopals-crypto-challenges
Here is the code I write as I work my way through Cryptopals Crypto Challenges. 

Just finished challenge four. 

The code decripts the file in challenge four then uses character frequency of Pride and Prejudice in order to pickout a plain text key from a set of possible keys.

Program is very much still in porgress.
